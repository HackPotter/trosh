This project is throughly incomplete and should not be used by anyone. It is not
offered on an "as-is" basis, mostly because I'm not offering it to anyone at
all. If you decide to use, copy, distribute, modify, download, upload, read,
look at, or interact with this code in any way (all of which you are free to do),
you do so without any warranty, any expectation of functionality (implied or 
explicitly stated), and without any claim that the original author (Jack Potter) 
is in any way responsible for the consequences of your actions.

If, for some reason, you decide to interact with this code in any way,you
release Jack Potter of any liability for any consequence, foreseen or
unforeseen, that may result from your interaction with this code.

If you distribute this code at all (why?) you have to include this license in
its entirety. You are also *strongly encouraged* to buy Jack a beer at the next
con, meetup, usergroup, meeting, or other event you meet him at. In lieu of a
beer, you can instead make a donation of similar value to the [Electronic
Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org), your call.
