# Trosh - The Troll Shell

This shell is pretty much what it says on the tin. It makes the user's life
difficult through a combination of being really poorly written and having some
actually malicious features hardcoded in. If you want a complete breakdown of
the mean things it does, [Check out my blog
post.](https://hackpotter.com/Introducing-Trosh,-the-Troll-Shell/)

Maybe at some point in the future I'll take the time to write a proper readme,
but don't hold your breath. 

Compiling: literally just run `make`

Useage: Don't

Also, FYI: This shell was originally written as an assignment for Computer
Engineering 308 at Iowa State University. If you are a fellow university student
searching for code to use in your own assignment, look somewhere else. First of
all, plagiarism is wrong, and second of all, this code is not high quality
enough for you to want to claim credit for it.
